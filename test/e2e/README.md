# NemoClaw E2E CI

Direct E2E coverage runs through Vitest.

Interactive TUI targets require `expect`. The unified workflow installs it
before those targets run; local runners must provide it themselves.

- `.github/workflows/e2e.yaml` is the scheduled and manually
  dispatchable live target workflow.
- `.github/workflows/e2e-branch-validation.yaml` provisions Brev instances and
  runs focused E2E targets from source on a clean machine.
- Platform workflows such as macOS, WSL, Ollama proxy, sandbox image, and
  regression E2E call their target E2E tests directly.

The former top-level `test/e2e/test-*.sh` suite has been removed. Keep real
shell, installer, process, Docker, OpenShell, `/proc`, and sandbox boundaries in
E2E tests when those boundaries are the behavior under test.

## Scheduled operations

The consolidated workflow keeps its operational reporting in the same job
graph as the live targets:

- GitHub Actions run history is the authoritative record for scheduled and
  manual E2E results.
- Automated issue routing and the workflow's `issues: write` capability are
  retired. Any future issue escalation should use a separately reviewed
  exceptional threshold, such as the same lane failing twice consecutively or
  remaining broken for 24 hours, rather than posting on every failed schedule.
- `scorecard` writes the scheduled/manual result summary, compares the trusted
  cloud-onboard timing summary with the latest prior-release `e2e.yaml` run,
  and posts to the daily or full-run Slack route.
- Selective dispatches remain silent unless they run on `main` with
  `post_to_slack=true`, which uses the preview Slack route. Branch-dispatched
  runs never receive Slack webhook secrets.

Raw cloud-onboard traces stay under the runner temporary directory. Before
artifact upload, `scripts/e2e/sanitize-trace-timing.py` reduces them to the
allowlisted `cloud-onboard-trace-timing-summary.json` timing schema and deletes
the raw directory. Aggregation ratchets require `report-to-pr` and `scorecard`
to wait for the same execution-job set.

Registry-driven Vitest targets also enable onboard trace collection. Each live
matrix target writes raw traces under the runner temporary directory, sanitizes
them before upload, deletes the raw trace directory, and uploads only
`e2e-artifacts/live/<target>/cloud-onboard-trace-timing-summary.json` with the
target artifact. These per-target summaries are artifact evidence only; the
Slack/GitHub scorecard comparison remains tied to the dedicated `cloud-onboard`
artifact so baseline aggregation stays stable.
Older issue references to Vitest target artifacts under `e2e-artifacts/vitest/`
map to this consolidated `e2e-artifacts/live/` registry-target artifact layout.

## Onboard performance budget

The scheduled/manual scorecard evaluates the trusted `cloud-onboard` timing
summary against `ci/onboard-performance-budget.json`. The budget covers the
warm-system path and is advisory: exceeding the total-duration cap or a
regression threshold emits a GitHub Actions warning and adds details to the run
summary, but does not fail the scorecard job.

The config separates the absolute total-duration budget from total and phase
regression thresholds. Phase regressions are diagnostic and are only compared
when the current run and prior-release baseline contain the same known onboard
phase names. Cold image pulls, first-time model downloads, provider outages,
and runner or network incidents can still affect the signal, so maintainers
should inspect the timing table before acting on a warning.

For PRs, E2E Advisor deterministically recommends the `cloud-onboard` target
when changes affect onboard behavior, trace timing, scorecard analysis, budget
configuration, or the unified E2E workflow. The scorecard remains the source
of truth for threshold evaluation.
